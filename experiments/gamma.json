This will be defined as Joe publicly announcing - via any medium, including social media - that he has tested positive for COVID-19, or some variation of that statement. If it is in reference to antibodies, or he doesn\u2019t publicly acknowledge it, the market will resolve to No.\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
